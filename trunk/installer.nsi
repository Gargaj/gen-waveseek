; This script generates an installer for a Winamp 2.x / 5.x plug-in.
;
; The installer will automatically close Winamp if it's running and then if
; successful, ask the user whether or not they would like to run Winamp with
; the newly installed plug-in.
;
; This is a single section installer but is easily altered for multiple
; sections and is based of the original Winamp installer script but tweaked
; to be easier to use i think :o)
